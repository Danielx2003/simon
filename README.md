# simon
simon is a game where there are 9 squares. They will flash in an order and you need to repeat the order back to them. If you get it right, the length of the sequence will increase by one. If you get it wrong the game will be over. It is basically the task from among us but a worse version

To fix:
- squares get 'replaced' every go which makes the game look buggy.
- after a few goes it seems like the time to do the sequence is not long enough, but on the first 1 or 2 goes is way too long.
- maybe add a countdown or an option where the user can choose the countdown.
